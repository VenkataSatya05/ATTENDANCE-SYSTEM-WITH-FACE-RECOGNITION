# Attendance System with Face Recognition

## üìå Introduction

The Attendance System with Face Recognition is a Python-based application designed to automate and streamline attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. Built with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), the system leverages computer vision and a folder-based database structure to provide a secure, scalable, and user-friendly solution for educational institutions, offices, and events.

Key Features:

Facial Recognition: Accurately identifies students using the face_recognition library for real-time attendance marking.

GUI Interface: Built with Tkinter, offering easy navigation for students and teachers.

Student Management: Supports registration, image capture, and attendance tracking, with teacher controls for viewing records and managing access.

Security Features: Includes camera access blocking/unblocking to prevent malpractice.

Scalable Database: Uses a folder-based structure for storing student images and attendance records, ensuring flexibility and ease of management.

Real-Time Processing: Captures and processes facial data instantly for efficient attendance monitoring.

The system enhances accuracy, reduces manual errors, and provides a robust platform for modern attendance management.

## üõ† Tech Stack

Layer	Tools/Frameworks

Frontend (GUI)	Tkinter

Computer Vision	OpenCV

Facial Recognition	face_recognition

Image Processing	PIL (Pillow)

Database	Folder-based (text files)

## üèõÔ∏è Overall Workflow
Login/Registration: Students register with a username and password, stored in student_database.txt. Teachers access the system with default credentials.

Image Capture: Students capture their facial image, saved in the student_images folder.

Attendance Marking: Students select a course and faculty, capture an image, and the system compares it with the registered image using facial recognition.

Teacher Controls: Teachers can view attendance records, student details, and images, delete students, and block/unblock camera access.

Output: Attendance records are stored in attendance_records.txt, with visual feedback via the GUI.

Students must take a picture of themselves as soon as they log in to their desks in order for facial detection to be utilized to take attendance.

Teachers are required to block student images once they are taken in order to prevent subsequent students from taking pictures of themselves until the instructor removes the block. This prevents future students from engaging in unethical attendance practices.

Following this, students can record their attendance by choosing a subject and faculty member. If the image recognition process matches the picture the student took, they will receive their attendance; if not, it will be denied.

## üìù Why This Project?

Manual attendance systems are prone to errors, time-consuming, and vulnerable to proxy attendance. The Attendance System with Face Recognition addresses these issues by:

1.Enhancing Accuracy: Uses facial recognition to ensure only authorized individuals are marked present.

2.Improving Efficiency: Automates attendance tracking, saving time for educators and administrators.

3.Ensuring Security: Features like camera access blocking prevent misuse.

4.User-Friendly Design: The Tkinter GUI is accessible to users with minimal technical expertise.

5.Scalability: The folder-based database supports dynamic organizational needs.

6.This project showcases the integration of computer vision and GUI design to solve real-world problems in attendance management.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How We Came to Solve This Problem?

The project was developed to address the limitations of traditional attendance systems:

1.Automation: Replaces manual roll-calls with real-time facial recognition.

2.Security: Prevents proxy attendance through image-based verification and access controls.

3.Accessibility: Provides an intuitive GUI for students and teachers, regardless of technical background.

4.Flexibility: Supports diverse environments like classrooms, offices, or events.

5.Future Potential: Can be enhanced with real-time notifications, cloud storage, or advanced recognition algorithms.
